        <p>
          Studies has shown that the conventional way of conducting
          examinations, where supervisors keep an eye on students has long
          served as a deterrent to academic misconduct. However, as education
          goes beyond limits and classrooms become virtual, guaranteeing the
          genuineness and honesty of assessments has become a complex task. for
          this reason the need, for a proctoring website is very essential to
          solve/ improve the following:
        </p>
      </div>
